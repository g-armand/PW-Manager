# PW-Manager
A simple password manager, coded with python

/!\ DO NOT USE THIS PASSWORD MANAGER /!\ 

This program only aims to train on GUI creation, to use external files, and to learn more about encryption and digital security. 

- As I am not a security expert, the cryption processes used in this program are not safe AT ALL.
  This program uses a vigenere cryption algorythm that is not safe if you want to store sensitive datas 
 
- This password manager was my first time ever using Tkinter, in order to offer a GUI.

- It stores (encrypted) datas in a external file, following this format: [[Application, User ID, Password], [Application, User, Password], ...]

- When the program is launched, you're asked to provide you decryption key (the main password, the only one you need to remember)

- In the main menu you have 4 options available:
    
    - Add a new password
    
    - Edit you passwords (optionnaly allows to generate a random and safe new password) and delete.
    
    - Display all passwords
    
    - Close the program
